# Instacart-data-project
This project works with data, that was made publicly available by "Instacart" in 2017. Python is the main programming tool to extract data insights.

Instacart is a californian online grocery shopping and convenient home delivery company. The data includes sets about customer orders, ordered products and product categories.
It was made publicly available for the purpose of a competition to predict which previously purchased product by a customer will likely end up being reordered.
This analysis doesn't attempt this, however the data still provides some interesting insights, that have been extracted with Python.
For the purpose to show my work with Python, the data also has been artificially enriched with a product price column and fabricated customer data.
