### OVERVIEW
This project compares booking data from two different hotels, focusing on evaluating basic metrics such as booking patterns, changes in pricing, and room selection by different guests. It unveils interesting insights from the dataset, providing a comprehensive understanding of booking dynamics within these hotels. The dataset, published for educational purposes, offers access to real business data, making it an excellent addition to my portfolio.

### PROJECT MOTIVATION
The motivation behind this project is to illustrate the fundamental economics of the hotel industry using the Hotel Booking Demand dataset. This analysis will not only showcase analytical skills but also contribute to an understanding of the hospitality industry.

### OBJECTIVES
The main objectives of the project are:
- To conduct a comparative analysis of two hotels to identify differences in customer demographics, booking seasonality, Average Daily Rate (ADR), and other factors.
- To show a simple supervised learning program to predict bookings, providing valuable insights into potential customer behavior.
- To visualize the data and findings.

### METHODS
The methodology for this project includes the utilization of Python for standard Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data wrangling, cleaning, and statistical analysis. Additionally, Tableau will be employed for the visualization of booking patterns. The project will also incorporate a supervised learning program, developed in Python to predict bookings given certain variables.

### DATA SOURCE
This data article describes two datasets with hotel demand data. One of the hotels (H1) is a resort hotel and the other (H2) is a city hotel. Both datasets share the same structure, with 31 variables describing 40,060 observations of H1 and 79,330 observations of H2. Each observation represents a hotel booking. The datasets include bookings due to arrive between July 1, 2015, and August 31, 2017, encompassing both arrived and canceled bookings. As this is real hotel data, all data elements pertaining to hotel or customer identification have been removed.
